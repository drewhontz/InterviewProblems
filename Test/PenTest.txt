- Are we doing white box or black box?
- Who will use it and why?
- What are the use cases?
- What are the bounds of use?
- What are the stress conditions?

- Are we doing white box or black box?
- In this case it seems like black box (since pen's have no potential for super user, unless you count disassembling the pen)

- Who will use it and why?
- Is this for a pen spinning competition? Is it for classroom music? Is it for constructing something out of pens?
- Will the pen be used to write? Will it need to fit in a pocket or pencil bag? Will it be heated in any fashion?
- Is the cap removable or is a twist or click?
- How heat resistant should this be?

Features:
- Write
- Open
- Close
- Storage?
- Clip
- Self-maintenance

Tests:
- Can we remove and replace the cap?
- Can we click it in and out multiple times?
- Can we twist it out and in without accessing the spring/ink?
- Will the pen write if the ball point is within the casing?
- Will the pen write from the opposing side of the ball?
- If placed in a pocket or fabric env, does the pen mark its env when jostled?
- Does the clip withstand the weight of the pen?
- Does the clip withstand forces greater than the force of the pen? If so, how can we rate this?
- If the pen runs out of ink, can we replace it easily?
- How and to what degree will users need to be helped to perform maintenance? I.e. new spring, ink, etc


How to improve for next time:
- Ask more around the 6s W's!
- Start with the feature list and unintended uses, then move to the tests
