Parking Lot

1)- For Who?
  - What kind of lot is it?
  - Where is the lot?
  - When is it being used?
  - Why are we building it?
  - How will it be used?

2) An amount of space, divisions between stalls to accommodate vehicles
(Optional) An arm to secure those trying to leave without payment
(Optional) Multiple floors/levels for the parking lot
(Optional) some form of teller or honor based drop box for payment

Spaces, Lot, Cars, Indicator, Levels, Payment Collection

Payment collection may or may not happen, it may expire as opposed to 'count up'

3) Lots have levels (even if it is just one) and payment collection
   Levels have spaces
   Spaces may have cars

public class Lot {
  private Level[] level;
  private PaymentCollection pc;

  public int size(){}

  public boolean isFull(){}

  private class Level{
    private int spaces;

    public int size(){}

    public boolean isFull(){}

  }
}

public interface PaymentCollection {

  public void collectPayment(int spotNumber){}

  public void isPaid(int spotNumber){}


}
